					<h2>Despite this being only a 3 day week I did some editing of some photos that I have taken from last week as I did not get to editing last week but that's what I got to do the days that we had open to work on stuff. I think that the white rock in this weeks "best of" is my favourite that I have created in the last week. I may have stated a small comic series because I ran out of things to edit.</h2>
