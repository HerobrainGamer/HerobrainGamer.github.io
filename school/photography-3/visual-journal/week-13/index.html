                        <h2>Well this week was fun we got some new photos and new ideas. Got to use some images from this class for another class(Creative Writing) got a good mark on it. Did a test on WW2 will update you next week on that also got a essay on a invention that was created during WW2. The pictures that you have one the board look neat. I'm still sure that I am a scary person to approach in the minds of kids and I have no idea why or how. With one other thing that has been hanging in the back of my mind is a thing that I made at the start of the year I'll leave a link to in as well. Now some of the pictures look a bit weird as I was playing with some of the settings to see what they looked like.</h2>
