					<h2>Well the first image is of a broken branch on a power line that should most likely not be there, the second one is the best shot of a dog that we passed on our way to a place to take some more pictures, and the third one is just a little macro of some pine tree needles that I wanted to see what it would look like. I have added some new pages that you can look at the Edits that I have done and one that holds all the Originals as well most links are click able but some are not complete</h2>
