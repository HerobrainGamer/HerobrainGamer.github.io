					<h2>This week was interesting as I have created some weird things that are not on this page and some things I have found out. I have added some new pages such as the Random Stuff page it has some of the random edits that I have done in between getting new photos to work with. Also in other news I have been tasked with creating a poem in Creative Writing and she gave us the option to do it digitally so I'm planning on crating a little 3min video and may use some of my images in it as short transitions between locations. There is a GitHub page linked that you can view the amount of stuff that is on there (if you want to see it just create a GitHub account and then I'll add you as I use the account that it is stored on for other projects and don't want the whole internet viewing it (If you do want to download it MAKE SURE YOU HAVE 4GB of storage to view the site as I have not gotten around to finding a host to host it))</h2>
