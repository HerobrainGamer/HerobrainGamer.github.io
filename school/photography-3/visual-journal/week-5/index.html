					<h2>Little side note before we get started with the writing is that Internet Explorer has not had a proper update to support newer version of html and why is the school still defaulting to using it? The photos that I have here are mostly experimental for this week the last one is F8.0 Aperture 15.0 it was just a thing that I wanted to try out this week because I was wondering what it would look like. Ian we need more AA batteries so we can keep taking pictures</h2>
