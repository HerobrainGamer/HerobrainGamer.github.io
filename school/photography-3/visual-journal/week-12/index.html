					<h2>This week was interesting as I got some more of the comic done with more things beginning to create in this small series that I decided to create in the time when I ran out of images that I saw a good picture in. There are things on the Edited page that are new as I whent back and looked for some images that I may have missed that could have a good picture in it somewhere.</h2>
