There is one thing that I want to state that is the comic is an indented project mostly because I had nothing to do at one point the first 10 episodes are season #1. I was also wondering if you would like to do a little group page with both classes where everyone hands in a picture or as many as they want and a little statement from them about the class.</h2>
