                        <p>The "Maser Mind" game we were told to use what have have learned in the previous unit to create the game. Once the game was made I asked one of the guys next to me to test it out and give some feed back. He played though it and than gave me the suggestion to add a previous guesses list so they know what they have previously choose.</p>

                        <p>The "Black Jack" game was made as a final project for programming 11. This was a way for us to test some of our understandings of what we have been working on over the past few months.</p>
